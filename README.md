# Apropos

Apropos helps your site serve up the appropriate image for every visitor. Serving multiple versions of an image in responsive and/or localized web sites can be a chore, but Apropos simplifies and automates this task. Instead of manually writing a lot of CSS rules to swap different images, Apropos generates CSS for you based on a simple file naming convention.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'apropos'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install apropos

## Usage

Apropos depends on [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), so make sure you have that installed and configured in your project.

### Sample configuration

It's easy to get up and running with Apropos' basic configuration. Here's a sample stylesheet:

```sass
// Put this in a .sass (or .scss) file, such as application.css.sass

// Substitute with your own breakpoint names and sizes
$apropos-breakpoints: (medium, 768px), (large, 1024px)
@import "apropos"
@import "apropos/hidpi"
@import "apropos/breakpoints"

.hero
  // Use hero.jpg as the background of this element, and load any image
  // variants that exist. If you use $generate-height: true, the function
  // will also generate height definitions based on the height of each
  // image (except dpi variants, since you want to display those at the
  // original dimensions).
  +apropos-bg-variants('hero.jpg', $generate-height: true)

  // Customize other background styles
  background-size: auto 100%
  background-position: 50%
```

With that configuration set up, you can include any set of variants on your image with a simple file naming convention:

    # File listing e.g. app/assets/images:
    hero.jpg
    hero.medium.jpg
    hero.large.jpg
    hero.2x.jpg
    hero.2x.medium.jpg
    hero.2x.large.jpg

In this example, `hero.jpg` would be your base image, most likely a mobile version. `hero.medium.jpg` would be swapped in at the 768px breakpoint, and `hero.large.jpg` would be swapped in at 1024px. On a high-dpi device, `hero.2x.jpg`, `hero.2x.medium.jpg`, and `hero.2x.large.jpg` would be used instead. Note that the order of the file extensions doesn't matter; `hero.2x.medium.jpg` and `hero.medium.2x.jpg` work exactly the same.

### Customization

You can customize Apropos' breakpoints as shown above, and you can also customize the definition of the "high dpi" variant:

```sass
// The default extension name is "2x", we're overriding to use "hidpi"
$apropos-hidpi-extension: "hidpi"
// The default ratio is 1.75 (or 168 dpi), but here we're overriding that
$apropos-hidpi-query: "(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-resolution: 192dpi)"
@import "apropos"
@import "apropos/hidpi"
```

If you want to do more advanced configuration like adding variants for localization, you can [customize Apropos in Ruby](doc-src/customization.md).

## Why use Apropos?

There are many tools and techniques for using responsive images. What makes Apropos different? A few key principles:

- Let the browser do what it does best. CSS rules are more efficient and reliable than a solution that relies on Javascript or setting cookies for each visitor.
- Avoid duplicate downloads. Almost all Javascript solutions, including polyfills for things like `srcset`, require unnecessary extra downloads, which CSS classes and media queries avoid.
- No server logic should be required. Rather than setting a cookie and serving up different assets based on the cookie, we should be able to push compiled CSS and images to a CDN and rely on the browser to request the right images.
- Take advantage of the "metadata" encoded in file names. We need to create separate assets for high-dpi devices, breakpoints, locales, etc anyway. We can lean on the filesystem with a simple naming convention rather than hand-coding a bunch of CSS.
